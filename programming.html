                    <p>Backstory:</p>
                    <p>     
                        Originally made with the intention of emulating old style desktop helpers, 
                        I wrote this to serve as a lightweight custom tailored version for my grandmother.
                        However, when our classes went online during my first year, I was getting frustrated with 
                        how the links of our classes were hidden in the most obscure places. And thus, I repurposed
                        this program to the tool it is today.

                        <p>Backstory:</p>
                        <p> This was a submission for one of the many events from the 
                            Game Design Club at UofT. Specifically the Fall 2022 Jam where I 
                             gathered a few interested peers to work together. Rushed as all game jams
                             always are, especially seen through the lighting (or the obvious lack of it).
                              It was an amazing experience staying overnight at school grinding assets 
                              and learning from everyone around me. :p

                        <p> Although having a background of game development, most of my projects 
                            were done with Unity. So this was my first time builting a game 
                            completely from scratch. Although we didn't use something like React,
                             we were still able to walk away with solid knowledge of Clean Architecture
                             for software development. Such as using interfaces to maintain independancy 
                             and the different layered design patterns.
